# Windows10.5.github.io
This is a customized build of Microsoft Windows that I created. I’ve removed unnecessary bloatware, telemetry, advertisements, and unwanted AI features to make it lightweight and fast using many open-source projects like 
1. Atlas OS 
2. Revi OS 
3. Rectify 11 
4. Explorer Patcher 
It’s based on Windows 10 but redesigned with a modern interface inspired by Windows 11, giving it a sleek and updated look.
